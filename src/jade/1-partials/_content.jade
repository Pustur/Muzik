     | Although a number of Node.js tutorials exist online, most lack the comprehensiveness necessary for learning Node.js properly. Moreover, you can easily spend a frustrating fortnight trying to find and discern the worthwhile tutorials from the fruitless ones. I read a good bit of Node.js tutorials when I learned Node.js a few years ago. I also wasted a good bit of time on many of them. I have done the hard work so you don’t have to go digging for Node.js tutorials.Don’t go to Amazon and choose a Node.js book based on the reviews. Even though this is the customary way to decide on a book, because Node.js is still a new platform, most of the books don’t have a large enough sample of reviews to provide you with a clear picture of the book’s usefulness and value. And collectively, the reviews are not great. If you go to Amazon.com and type “Node.js,” you will see at least 21 Node.js books. While I have only read five of them (the five best of the lot), I found a pattern in the books that were not good: the authors do not appear to have a vast and rich understanding of the Node.js architecture and platform, and the books appear to be a collection of mediocre tutorials aggregated for the book.   Of the five Node.js books I have read, two are good, though I recommend only one. The two worthwhile books are Professional Node.js: Building JavaScript Based Scalable Software, by Pedro Teixera; and Smashing Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere, by Guillermo Rauch. I recommend Pedro Teixera’s book, but you can learn quite a bit from Guillermo Rauch’s book, too, so you should get both, if you are serious about developing with Node.jsBook ReviewAs of this writing,  there are only two reviews of Professional Node.js: Building JavaScript Based Scalable Software (Pedro Teixera’s book) on Amazon.com; one of them is excellent (5 stars) and the other is a bad review–it is best if you read it yourself. This is the bad review of the book:I have no idea if this book is well written or not because the formatting is so bad as to make it virtually unreadable in some places.Obviously, the author of this review has not read the book and his review is completely about the formatting, which I have not experienced. I would give the book 5 stars because it is by far the best Node.js book I have read.Also note that I know neither of the authors of the two books I recommend in this article.ResourcesGet a copy of The Node Beginner Book by Manuel Kiessling. It is a tiny book: it is really a Node.js tutorial. The book sells in a bundle with another book, Hands-on Node.js written by the aforementioned Pedro Teixeira, for $9.99. But interestingly, I didn’t find the companion book (by Pedro) to be as useful, so you don’t need it and we will not use it in our study of Node.js. But since you get both books for $9.99, take the deal and run.

As I noted above, it is a tiny book; basically a tutorial. This tutorial will give you a gentle introduction into Node.js and a very basic understanding of what Node.js development involves. It is good to start with this before you read the rest of the Professional Node.js   book.
